        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <p>With so many cloud storage platforms on the market, is there room to throw another hat in the ring? The cloud storage industry has evolved dramatically and users needs have evolved with it. I set out to uncover the problems users face today and
          build a product that met those needs.
          <br/>
          <br/>The main problems users experience:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Finding files is difficult</li>
          <li>Organizing files is cumbersome and requires constant upkeep</li>
          <li>Saving links across devices isn’t convenient</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>The Solution</h3>
        <p>A flexible storage space that lets users store notes, images and links all in one place and smart organization tools to keep users on top of file management.
          <br/>
          <br/> Key design features:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Introduce automated tagging to help users manage their files </li>
          <li>Make saving easier with a browser extension added to any device making it easier to save to one place</li>
        </ul>

          <br/>
          <br/> <span>Based on the user feedback, I made the following changes:</span></p>

        <p>I went through several sketches and iterations before landing on the final logo with input from senior designers. I ended up with three directions for the logo:</p>

          <li>A box encased in the “V” to represent treasured items a user stores in Trove</li>
          <li>A modern hand-drawn typeface drawing parallels to Trove’s smart and modern user base</li>
          <li>A treasure chest or compass to play off the brand name</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I landed on a simple wordmark in Julius Sans One with an accompanying icon. The typography has a sophisticated touch that makes it feel balanced and reliable. While the curvature of the ‘R’ adds a bit of personal flare. The diamond icon is versatile
          and stands out as a memorable icon. </p>

            <br/> I asked users which sign up background image best reflected the brand identity. I included the hero image for context since it provides the clearest insight into the branding direction.
            <br/>
            <br/> Although the data wasn’t statistically significant, users felt that both images conveyed a similar calming and positive vibe. Users felt that the Screen A followed the brand identity slightly more than the second.</p>

        <p>Armed with fresh insights from my users, <span>a few things were clear:</span>
          <br/>
          <br/><span>1) The categories weren’t working.</span> Several users didn’t understand the functional difference between categories and tags and I realized they were absolutely right. I wanted to make it easier for users to organize, but I soon realized
          it was at the expense of other organization features that had been validated by user testing, so I nixed the categories!</p>

          liked the clickable icon to view all the tags in a separate dropdown, so I made the change. Users also noted that it made the interface feel less cluttered when the tags were accessible via an icon. </p>

        <p><span>3) Clarifying the product’s tagline wasn’t a bad idea.</span>Although most users agreed the hero image was inspiring and reflected the creativity brand, I modified the sub-tagline to include the term “cloud storage tool” to reinforce that
          this was, in fact, a cloud storage application. </p>

        <h4>CONCLUSION</h4>
        <h3>BRINGING IT ALL TOGETHER</h3>
        <p>I sought to create a flexible storage space that allowed users to upload, add and save content easily, and the user testing proves that these tasks were highly intuitive. One thing I did not expect was how the product started to align with a personal
          cloud storage space rather than a space that fit the needs of users both professionally and personally. This is largely because the sharing and collaborative features could use more work. With more time, I would improve the existing organizational
          features to streamline smart tagging in every user flow, not just the high priority ones.</p>
        <h3>LESSONS LEARNED</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><span>Stick to the challenges at hand and avoid tackling everything </span>
            <br/>
            <br/> Going into this project, I found it difficult to settle on a direction. Not only was I skeptical about how to create a better product than some of the competitors on the market, I wanted to tackle all the problems that existed. In doing so,
            there were times when I lost sight of the original problems present in my research. </li>
          <li><span>Consistency is everything</span>
            <br/>
            <br/>The biggest challenge was maintaining consistency across UI elements and establishing patterns for user interaction and animations early on. Making a list of how elements would interact with one another was a good way to keep me in check.</li>
          <li><span>Empathy</span>
            <br/>
            <br/>Throughout the project, I repeatedly asked myself how users would respond to different scenarios and tried to make strategic decisions based on the data, which worked out most of the time (the categories being the only pitfall!). Overwhelmingly,
            users commented on the product’s intuitive feel and soothing colors, accurately describing the feeling I hoped to convey through the design.</li>
        </ul>
