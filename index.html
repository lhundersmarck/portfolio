        <h4>MY DESIGN PROCESS</h4>
        <h3>FROM IDEAS TO ACTION</h3>
        <img src="assets/img/speciality-font-understand.svg"></img>
        <p>I start by defining the problem and scope of work. Then gather user research and analyze the competition.</p>
        <img src="assets/img/speciality-font-ideate.svg"></img>
        <p>I develop user stories and user flows, begin sketching wireframes, and conducting early testing.</p>
        <img src="assets/img/speciality-font-adjust.svg"></img>
        <p>Next, I refine wireframes based on testing data and develop high-fidelity mockups for further testing.</p>
        <img src="assets/img/speciality-font-develop.svg"></img>
        <p>Lastly, I develop functional prototypes and deliver finished products through frontend development.</p>
